Simplify Web3 onboarding, and welcome new users to your app - even if they're new to blockcain. Collaborate quickly with frictionless account creation, unique blockchain identities, and gasless transactions using only a Google account.

## Project Overview
The Pandsal project, named after the universally familiar bread that starts the day for many in the Philippines, is a pioneering endeavor to welcome Web2 users into Web3 in a much easier way. The mission is to enable and encourage users to interact with their beloved Web3 apps with fewer steps - especially if this is their first blockchain experience. All without sacrificing the decentralization and security of the technology. Conventionally, the journey into blockchain and decentralized applications (dApps) can be daunting, requiring know-how of complex cryptocurrency wallet downloads and the management of sensitive private keys. This isn't the most appealing entry into an otherwise exciting world. It needs to be simple, dependable, instant and versatile - like **pandesal!**

The Pandsal onboarding kit is here to remove those barriers and deliver accessibility for all. Whether you're a consumer eager to explore the possibilities of Web3, or a business trying to harness the potential of blockchain technology, Pandsal has you covered.

We've reimagined onboarding by minimizing - or delaying - the need for users or enterprises to grapple with private keys and downloading wallets., serving a seamless and secure transition. It's not a wallet, but a user-friendly, self-custodial gateway to the Ethereum network. No more depending on private keys or panicking over intimidating jargon before they're ready. 

Simply put, with Pandesal, your users are empowered to create accounts, access dApps, and manage digital assets in just a click or two. Tailor-fit it to your business's needs!

With Pandesal at your service, your business or dApp can have full control over the full experience. Easy and dependable way to get you started.

This groundbreaking approach democratizes Web3 access, promising a more inclusive and accessible future for blockchain technology. Start your day with Pandsal. Take a byte and we promise it'll be a great one.

## Features:

1. **Simplify Blockchain: Easy Onboarding:** Blockchain can be a complex and intimidating term, often associated with scams and technical jargon like "zero-knowledge proof" and "cryptocurrency." But we're here to make it easy to understand. <br/><br/> Think back to the early days of social media and online shopping. You didn't need to install a special wallet to get started, did you? Just an email address was enough. In the same way, Pandsal simplifies the process. When you hit the "connect" or "sign in" button, we use your familiar email address from the web2 world to instantly create a wallet and an account. It's that simple. No need to dive into the complexities of blockchain technology – Pandsal brings it to you in a way that anyone can grasp. As easy as it may get to start, the development and what's happening behind the scenes is far from the word "easy." We've taken the security of this project seriously.

2. **Walletless Onboarding:** We save you from the hassle of downloading, installing, and creating a wallet. The entire onboarding process is designed to effortlessly generate the necessary accounts for you to start in Web3. Users can create unique wallet addresses derived from their email addresses. Getting your email address is not enough. An email address is considered public information, and it can be accessed by anyone. Therefore, what we've done is transform and shield it with multiple layers of security. <br/> <br/> Importantly, we've ensured that this transformation is deterministic, meaning that no matter what happens, your email address will reliably return the same wallet address. This way, your personal information remains secure, even though it starts with something as common as an email address. These addresses can be deployed on various blockchain networks. If a user engages in malicious activity, they can be banned from that particular network.

3. **Gasless Transaction Deployment:** "What is gas fee? Why do I need to pay gas? Where will I get the payment for the gas fee?" These are some of the common questions users often ask when they start exploring blockchain. Understanding the concept of gas fees can indeed take some time. </br></br> Here's where we come in: we've got you covered. We handle the payment for gas fees when you deploy and create your user's smart account, engage in peer-to-peer transactions, or deploy a contract. You don't have to worry about handling the intricacies of gas fees – we make it seamless for you. Users can deploy their deterministic contract addresses without the need to pay gas fees, making it easier for them to get started on the blockchain. <br/><br/>
**We offer two convenient methods for paying gas fees:** <br/>
**a. Safe Protocol + Relay Kit:** This method combines the safety of the Safe Protocol with the efficiency of the Relay Kit, ensuring a secure and reliable way to handle gas fees. <br/>
**b. Pandsal Multisig ZK-Paymaster:** Our Pandsal Multisig ZK-Paymaster is another option, providing a versatile and user-friendly approach to managing gas fees.<br/>

4. **Multisig Deployment Transaction** To ensure the utmost security for your assets, we have integrated Safe's Multisignature feature and harnessed the power of their Protocol Kit and API kits in our development process. This robust combination enhances asset protection and strengthens the overall security of our platform.

5. **Enhanced Privacy:** One of the challenges that businesses and enterprises face when considering the adoption of public blockchains is the inherent publicness and transparency of these networks. To address this concern, we have implemented zero-knowledge roll-up technology, ensuring that from the creation of accounts to the transfer of assets and data, everything is executed with the utmost security and privacy in mind. This approach allows for a more confidential and secure experience within the public blockchain ecosystem.

6. **DeFi Ready:** We've always kept in mind that what we're building should be versatile and useful in various ways, including as a DeFi-ready application. While time constraints prevented us from managing the integration of the Compound protocol at this moment, the current version of Pandsal is primed and ready for such integrations whenever the need arises. Our commitment to adaptability ensures that we can seamlessly incorporate these features in the future. <br/><br/>Our DeFi integration isn't limited solely to the Compound Protocol. Pandsal's capabilities extend to cross-chain transactions, thanks to the utilization of CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) and more. This means that our platform is designed to support a wide range of DeFi functionalities and can facilitate transactions across different blockchain networks, enhancing its flexibility and utility in the DeFi space.<br/><br/>

7. **Simplify Blockchain: Endless Possibilities:** The base contract deployed for every user can be uniquely tailored to meet the specific needs of businesses or individual users. Imagine this scenario: you run a business, and you wish to incorporate web3 features for your employees. With Pandsal's onboarding kit, there's no need for them to invest time in learning, downloading, and installing wallets or navigating through various exchanges just to get started. Pandsal streamlines the entire process.<br/><br/>
But here's the exciting part— the base contract, which we deploy, can be customized to suit the exact requirements of the business. For instance, you can integrate a time tracking feature into the base contract to automate employee payrolls. You can create a feature to automatically invest the company's income in different DeFi platforms, ensuring that your funds are not sitting idly. Or you could establish an employee cooperative within the company, powered by the Base smart contract, where employees can benefit from those who borrow.<br/><br/>
These are just a few examples of what can be accomplished with our platform. The possibilities are virtually endless, and as I mentioned before, the potential is limitless.
