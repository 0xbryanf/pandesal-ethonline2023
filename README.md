## Project Overview
Pandesal revolutionizes collaborative finance with a focus on user-friendly, secure, and efficient blockchain interactions. By offering deterministic wallet addresses, gasless transaction deployment, unique blockchain identities, and multi-signature security, Pandesal creates a supportive ecosystem for groups of friends to manage their finances together.

## Idea
Our DeFi platform is tailored for groups of friends looking to generate income while supporting one another. Here's how Pandesal works:

```markdown
1. **Deterministic Wallet Addresses:** Users can create unique wallet addresses derived from their email addresses. These addresses can be deployed on various blockchain networks, ensuring uniqueness for each user. If a user engages in malicious activity, they can be banned from that particular network.

2. **Gasless Transaction Deployment:** Users can deploy their deterministic contract addresses without the need to pay gas fees, making it easier for them to get started on the blockchain.

3. **Identity Establishment:** Once users have their deterministic contract address, they establish their identity on the blockchain. This identity is the foundation for participation in various activities on the platform.

4. **Group Formation:** Users can create groups and invite their friends to join. These groups collaborate to generate income through shared financial activities.

5. **Income Generation:** Groups can pool their money and invest it in the Compound protocol, a lending and borrowing DeFi platform. The income generated from these investments is distributed directly to the deterministic contract addresses of all group members.

6. **Guarantor System:** In cases where a member wants to make a purchase but lacks sufficient funds, other members can step in as guarantors. Smart contracts ensure that the lender will be repaid in full, along with interest, by the debtor, offering a safety net for financial transactions within the group.

7. **Safe Multi-Signature for Gasless Transactions:** Pandesal offers a robust security layer through Safe Multi-Signature for Gasless Transactions. This functionality ensures that group members can collectively approve and execute transactions securely without the need to pay individual gas fees.
