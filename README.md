## Project Overview
Pandesal revolutionizes collaborative finance with a focus on user-friendly, secure, and efficient blockchain interactions. By offering deterministic wallet addresses, gasless transaction deployment, unique blockchain identities, and multi-signature security, Pandesal creates a supportive ecosystem for groups of friends to manage their finances together.

## Idea
Our DeFi platform is tailored for groups of friends looking to generate income while supporting one another. Here's how Pandesal works:

1. **Deterministic Wallet Addresses:** Users can create unique wallet addresses derived from their email addresses. These addresses can be deployed on various blockchain networks, ensuring uniqueness for each user. If a user engages in malicious activity, they can be banned from that particular network.

2. **Gasless Transaction Deployment:** Users can deploy their deterministic contract addresses without the need to pay gas fees, making it easier for them to get started on the blockchain.

3. **Identity Establishment:** Once users have their deterministic contract address, they establish their identity on the blockchain. This identity is the foundation for participation in various activities on the platform.

4. **Group Formation:** Users can create groups and invite their friends to join. These groups collaborate to generate income through shared financial activities.

5. **Income Generation:** Groups can pool their money and invest it in the Compound protocol, a lending and borrowing DeFi platform. The income generated from these investments is distributed directly to the deterministic contract addresses of all group members.

6. **Guarantor System:** In cases where a member wants to make a purchase but lacks sufficient funds, other members can step in as guarantors. Smart contracts ensure that the lender will be repaid in full, along with interest, by the debtor, offering a safety net for financial transactions within the group.

7. **Safe Multi-Signature for Gasless Transactions:** Pandesal offers a robust security layer through Safe Multi-Signature for Gasless Transactions. This functionality ensures that group members can collectively approve and execute transactions securely without the need to pay individual gas fees.

In summary, Pandesal is designed to facilitate a supportive and secure environment for groups of friends to manage their finances collaboratively on the blockchain. It offers features like deterministic addresses, gasless deployment, multi-signature for gasless transactions, income generation through investments, and a guarantor system to enhance financial cooperation among users.
